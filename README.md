Deep Structured Features for Semantic Segmentation (PDF)

We propose a highly structured neural network architecture for semantic segmentation of images that combines i) a Haar wavelet-based tree-like convolutional neural network (CNN), ii) a random layer realizing a radial basis function kernel approximation, and iii) a linear classifier. While stages i) and ii) are completely pre-specified, only the linear classifier is learned from data. Thanks to its high degree of structure, our architecture has a very small memory footprint and thus fits onto low-power embedded and mobile platforms. We apply the proposed architecture to outdoor scene and aerial image semantic segmentation and show that the accuracy of our architecture is competitive with conventional pixel classification CNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture is data efficient in the sense of matching the accuracy of pixel classification CNNs when trained on a much smaller data set.

What makes ImageNet good for transfer learning? (PDF, Project/Code, Reading Note)

The tremendous success of features learnt using the ImageNet classification task on a wide range of transfer tasks begs the question: what are the intrinsic properties of the ImageNet dataset that are critical for learning good, general-purpose features? This work provides an empirical investigation of various facets of this question: Is more pre-training data always better? How does feature quality depend on the number of training examples per class? Does adding more object classes improve performance? For the same data budget, how should the data be split into classes? Is fine-grained recognition necessary for learning good features? Given the same number of training classes, is it better to have coarse classes or fine-grained classes? Which is better: more classes or more examples per class?

Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (PDF, Project/Code, Reading Note)
Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients (PDF)

Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modeled sub-graph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modeling error gradients: by using the modeled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously.

Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision (PDF, Reading Note)

In this paper, several network designing choices are discussed, including factorizing convolutions into smaller kernels and asymmetric kernels, utility of auxiliary classifiers and reducing grid size using convolution stride rather than pooling.

How to build a robot that “sees” with $100 and TensorFlow

I wanted to build a robot that could recognize objects. Years of experience building computer programs and doing test-driven development have turned me into a menace working on physical projects. In the real world, testing your buggy device can burn down your house, or at least fry your motor and force you to wait a couple of days for replacement parts to arrive.

What you need to know about data augmentation for machine learning Plentiful high-quality data is the key to great machine learning models. But good data doesn’t grow on trees, and that scarcity can impede the development of a model. One way to get around a lack of data is to augment your dataset. Smart approaches to programmatic data augmentation can increase the size of your training set 10-fold or more. Even better, your model will often be more robust (and prevent overfitting) and can even be simpler due to a better training set.
